# Machine Learning Assignment
This is a repository for the development of a curricular ML Assignment in the context of FCUP's ML subject.

## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to design a modification of an SVM inspired by random forests. Our SVM model runs several different SVMs with different sets of features of the dataset and then attributes weights to each SVM as a form of balancing the output.

# Testing

Testing is designed to compare the metrics of our SVM with the one implemented on the sklearn package.

This is done by using the test.py file.

The dataset_names list are the names of the different openML datasets for the script to test.
