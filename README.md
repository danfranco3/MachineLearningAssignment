# Machine Learning Assignment
This is a repository for the development of a curricular ML Assignment in the context of FCUP's ML subject.

## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to design a modification of an SVM inspired by random forests. Our SVM model runs several different SVMs with different sets of features of the dataset and then attributes weights to each SVM as a form of balancing the output.

# Running

The dataset_names list are the names of the different openML datasets for the script to test.

Running the Main.ipynb file will prompt the test the begin and print the metrics for some SVM tests.
